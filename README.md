I worked on an extended SQL project analyzing COVID-19 datasets that focused on Finland 🇫🇮 in comparison with other Nordic countries 🌍. This project applied my knowledge of SQL to a wide range of queries on two important datasets: COVID-19 death statistics 💔 and vaccination data 💉.

Data Exploration:
Gained insights by exploring the raw datasets of COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations 📊.
Created vaccination statistics by date and location to review the distribution and progress of vaccination campaigns in Finland and other Nordic countries 📅.

Trend Analysis:
Analyzed death statistics by date and location to find possible trends in COVID-19 fatalities across Finland and its Nordic counterparts 🔍.
Extracted COVID-19 data specific to Finland to better comprehend the situation within the country 🏠.
Calculated the share of the population infected with COVID-19 in Finland 📈.
Compared the rates of infection and total death count for Finland against those of other Nordic nations ⚖️.

Continental Insights:
Analyzed the continental trends in the COVID-19 death toll, focusing on the Nordic countries 🌏.
Calculated the share of deaths and total cases by continent 🌐.
Carried out rolling analysis to capture the accumulation of vaccinated individuals over time by location ⏳.

Key Insights and Impact:
The project really opened my eyes to how the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, the vaccination drive, and its effectiveness in Finland compared to the rest of the Nordic countries 🏥. In this respect, analysis of data supported by SQL queries lent further insight into the complicated dynamics of the pandemic, thereby enhancing my understanding of global health-related issues 🌟.
